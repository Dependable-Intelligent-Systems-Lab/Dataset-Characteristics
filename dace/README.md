## D-ACE: Dataset Assessment and Characteristics Evaluation

D-ACE is a framework designed to assess the quality and characteristics of datasets, helping to identify any potential issues that may affect the performance of machine learning algorithms. This framework provides a comprehensive evaluation of the dataset, taking into account factors such as missing values, class imbalance, data heterogeneity, and more. D-ACE can be used to improve the dependability of machine learning algorithms by providing a detailed evaluation of the dataset and identifying any potential issues that may affect the performance of the algorithms. By addressing these issues and ensuring the quality of the dataset, the performance of machine learning algorithms can be improved, leading to more accurate and reliable results. In general, D-ACE can be a valuable tool for measuring the quality of datasets and ensuring the dependability of machine learning algorithms.
